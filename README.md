# Discord-Music_BOT

Here is my music bot made for discord to play songs using Youtube Links. The Bot has features like play, stop, random msging and showing bot owner credits. The Bot is currently running on Discord's free API.
The Bot's code has been written in PYTHON Language, using Discord, discord voice clients and youtube search library.
The Prefix for the commands is '?'. (Eg. ?play (link), ?stop, ?hello, ?die)
